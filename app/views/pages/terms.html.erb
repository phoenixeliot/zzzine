  <h3>1. GENERAL</h3>
  <p>
  ZZZINE provides services through its websites, programs and computer servers, including but not limited to tweet aggregation. (All such services are referred to collectively herein as "ZZZINE.") By accessing or using ZZZINE, you are a "user" and you accept and agree to the terms below (the "Terms of Use" or "TOS") as a legal contract between you and ZZZINE. ZZZINE may post changes to the TOS at any time, and any such changes will be applicable to all subsequent access to or use of ZZZINE. 
  </p><p>
  If you do not accept and agree to all provisions of the TOS, now or in the future, you may reject the TOS by immediately terminating all access and use of ZZZINE, in which case any continuing access or use of ZZZINE is unauthorized.
  </p><p>
  You are also required to comply with, and to ensure compliance with, all laws, ordinances and regulations applicable to your activities on ZZZINE.
  </p><p>
  ZZZINE is intended and designed for users 18 years of age and older, and access or use by anyone younger is not authorized.
  </p><p>
  The TOS grant you a limited, revocable, nonexclusive license to access ZZZINE and use ZZZINE, in whole or in part, including but not limited to ZZZINE intellectual property therein, solely in compliance with the TOS.
  </p><p>
  "ZZZINE" is a trademark of ZZZINE and is protected by United States and international laws. The TOS do not authorize you to use "ZZZINE" or any similar or related marks for any use pertaining to social networks, online communication services or any similar or related use, or any other use that is likely to cause confusion on the part of, to cause mistake by or to deceive the public as to any affiliation, connection, association, origin, sponsorship, approval or endorsement by or with ZZZINE.
  </p>
  <h3>2. MODERATION</h3>
  <p>
  ZZZINE has the right, but not the obligation, to regulate content (which includes but is not limited to postings, text, code, images, video, binary files, ads, accounts, account information, emails, and any other user communications ("content")) posted to, stored on or transmitted via ZZZINE by any user (or any other third party in any manner); to regulate conduct (including but not limited to any authorized or unauthorized access to or use of ZZZINE) by any user (or any other third party in any manner); and to enforce the TOS, for any reason and in any manner or by any means that ZZZINE, in its sole discretion, deems necessary or appropriate (including but not limited to automated and manual screening, blocking, filtering, exclusion from index pages, exclusion from search results, requiring the use of an application programming interface (API), requiring the use of a bulk posting interface, authorization, verification, and the deletion and/or termination of content, accounts and/or all or any use or access). ZZZINE may, in its sole discretion and without notice, start, stop or modify any regulation or enforcement measures at any time. ZZZINE action or inaction to regulate content or conduct or to enforce against any potential violation of the TOS by any user (or any other third party) does not waive ZZZINE's right to implement or not implement regulation or enforcement measures with respect to any subsequent or similar content, conduct or potential TOS violation.
  </p><p>
  You also understand and agree that any action or inaction by ZZZINE or any of its directors, officers, stockholders, employees, consultants, agents or representatives (collectively, "ZZZINE Representatives") to prevent, restrict, redress or regulate content, or to implement other enforcement measures against any content, conduct or potential TOS violation is undertaken voluntarily and in good faith, and you expressly agree that neither ZZZINE nor any ZZZINE Representative shall be liable to you or anyone else for any action or inaction to prevent, restrict, redress, or regulate content, or to implement other enforcement measures against any content, conduct or potential violation of the TOS.
  </p><p>
  Although ZZZINE Representatives may moderate content, conduct and TOS compliance on ZZZINE at ZZZINE's discretion, ZZZINE Representatives have no authority to make binding commitments, promises or representations to anyone that they or anyone else on behalf of ZZZINE will "take care" of any alleged problem or complaint, or that they or anyone else on behalf of ZZZINE will otherwise stop, cure or prevent any problem, content, conduct or purported TOS violation from occurring or recurring. Accordingly, you further agree that any representation (written or verbal) by any ZZZINER epresentative (or by anyone else acting on behalf of ZZZINE or by anyone purportedly acting on behalf of ZZZINE) that ZZZINE (including but not limited to any ZZZINE Representative, anyone else acting on behalf of ZZZINE, or anyone purportedly acting on behalf of ZZZINE) would or would not prevent, restrict, redress or regulate content (including, without limitation, screen, block, moderate, review, remove, terminate, delete, edit or otherwise stop, cure or exclude any content), or to implement other enforcement measures against any content, conduct or potential or purported TOS violation is superseded by this provision and is nonbinding and unenforceable. Specifically, you agree that ZZZINE, ZZZINE Representatives and anyone else authorized to act on behalf of ZZZINE shall in no circumstance be liable as a result of any representation that ZZZINE, a ZZZINE Representative or anyone else on behalf of ZZZINE would or would not restrict or redress any content, conduct or potential or purported TOS violation. This paragraph may not be modified, waived or released except by a written agreement, dated and signed by ZZZINE's Chief Executive Officer and dated and signed by the individual or entity to whom the modification, waiver or release is granted.
  </p><p>
  ZZZINE also has the right in its sole discretion to limit, modify, interrupt, suspend or discontinue all or any portions of ZZZINE at any time without notice. ZZZINE and ZZZINE Representatives shall not be liable for any such limitations, modifications, interruptions, suspensions or discontinuance, or any purported losses, harm or damages arising from or related thereto.
